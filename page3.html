        Alice in Borderland (Japanese: 今際の国のアリス, Hepburn: Imawa no Kuni no Arisu) is a 2020 Japanese science fiction thriller drama streaming television series based on the manga by Haro Aso. The series was directed by Shinsuke Sato. It stars Kento Yamazaki and Tao Tsuchiya as allies trapped in an abandoned Tokyo forced to compete in dangerous games, the type and difficulty represented by playing cards, to extend "visas" that, if expired, result in the player's execution by lasers being shot from the sky.
        The series' first season was announced in July 2019 and filmed from August to December 2019. Set locations included Shibuya districts and a green screen studio replica of Shibuya Crossing. The show's visual effects were produced in an international collaboration between Japan's Digital Frontier and teams from Singapore, the United States, and India. The musical score was composed by Yutaka Yamada, who had collaborated with Sato.
        The first season premiered on the Netflix streaming service on December 10, 2020, and received positive reviews from critics, who liked the action, camerawork, and acting; they compared the show to many entries in the survival genre, including the films Battle Royale (2000) and Cube (1997). The first season's strong performance and high viewership in many countries resulted in Netflix's renewal of the series two weeks after its premiere; the second season was released on December 22, 2022.

        The manner in which the second season of “Alice in Borderland” ended raised a lot of questions regarding whether all that was happening with the characters was real or not. Arisu, Usagi, and others had come back to life in the mortal realm, and to make matters even more confusing, their memories had been wiped out. They had declined the offer to reside in the Borderland, and the next thing they knew, they were the survivors of a meteor crash. So, let’s analyze the narrative and understand if the Borderland was an actual place or merely a figment of imagination of those who had that particular near-death experience.
