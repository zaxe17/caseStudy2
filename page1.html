        It is well-known that Michelangelo was an exceptional artist, architect and sculptor. However, not many people know that he was also an expert anatomist, who used to dissect corpses with the intention of producing anatomical sketches!
        There are reasons to believe that Michelangelo left such anatomical illustrations behind in many of his works. The Creation of Adam, one of his most iconic works in the Sistine Chapel, is one such example.

        Concealed within the robes and the faces of the figure of God, is a representation of the human brain - which many believe was the artist’s attempt at a covert attack on the church’s contempt for science!
